He has been one of the most vociferous advocates of free software in his fight against software patents and dangerous extensions of copyright law.

The remarkable work undertaken by Dr. Stallman has been recognized worldwide and has led to him being awarded the ACM Grace Hopper Award, a MacArthur Foundation fellowship, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Pioneer Award, and the the Takeda Award for Social/Economic Betterment, as well as several doctorates honoris causa.

He has authored some extremely insightful books, including Byline, Nehru: The Making of India, Kashmir: Behind the Vale, Riot After Riot and India: The Siege Within which have garnered praise from the critics and readers alike.

She won the First Prize for her poem Kali in the "All India Poetry Competition" in 1990 organised by The Poetry Society (India) in collaboration with British Council. She is currently a Professor at Humanities and Social Sciences department of the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IIT Delhi). Nair is known for being a trenchant critic of the Hindutva ideology and the religious and caste discrimination that it promotes.

Nair serves on the editorial boards of the International Journal of Literary Semantics (De Gruyter: Berlin & New York), The Journal of Multicultural Discourses (Multilingual Matters: London and Beijing); The Journal of Pragmatics (Elseiver: Amsterdam); Psychology & Social Practice (an e-journal) and The Macmillan Essential Dictionary among others. 

As the editor of Biblio, India's leading literary and cultural journal, she is also part of the Australian ABC Radio's panel of experts for its well-known program 'The Book Show'. In addition, she contributes to all major national dailies and magazines and is a frequent panellist on Mark Tully's BBC broadcast 'Something Understood'.

There is much to admire in Nair’s poetry: the technical refinement, the range of allusion and the verbal energy and ingenuity. It is intellectually rigorous poetry and Nair has no qualms about admitting it.

Nair's writings, both creative and critical, are taught on courses at universities such as Chicago, Toronto Kent, Oxford and Washington, and she contends that she writes poetry for the same reason that she does research in cognitive linguistics – to discover the limits of language.

Her awards and fellowships include J.N. Tata Scholarship, the Hornby Foundation Award and the Dorothy Lee Grant besides winning Poetry prizes of Poetry Society  """                                  ### content
